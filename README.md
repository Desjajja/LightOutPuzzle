# LightOutPuzzle

Attemps to solve [Lights Out Puzzle](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/LightsOutPuzzle.html) with Python.
---

It started with the famous Warcraft minigame which my roommate is somewhat bothered with. I thought it wouldn't hurt but I was completely misled at the begining
finding ways to solve it in a linear algebra way.(where I'm not a expert) And that resulted the GenMatrix.py( a bitwise-xor-mannered gaussian elimination process on matrices)
The rank of the final triangular matrix is not full-ranked(anyhow I guess the problem is way complex since it's not a traditional linear equation group but a logical one)

In the end, I made reference to [a brutal force solution](https://blog.csdn.net/MHL_1208980380/article/details/54618002) and re-implemented it in python. It's super fast though without any due optimization. I boastful named it *Lights Out Killer*.
Shame on me.

I should have explained more of the background of this puzzle, although, who cares, maybe later. Now my left shoulder is killing me...
